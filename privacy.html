            <p class="lead">
                Your fishing memories are yours. We built Stillwater to keep it that way.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Stillwater, we collect and use personal information only as needed to deliver our app and services, and to communicate with you about them. Nothing more.
            </p>

            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <p>
                We collect information you provide directly when creating an account or using the app — things like your name, email address, and billing information. We also use cookies and similar technologies to understand how you interact with our services and to keep things running smoothly.
            </p>

            <h2>How we use it</h2>
            <p>
                We believe in collecting only what we need. We use your information for three purposes: (1) what you've given us permission for, (2) what's necessary to deliver the services you're using, and (3) what we may be required to do by law.
            </p>

            <h2>How we protect it</h2>
            <p>
                We follow accepted standards to protect your personal information, both during transmission and in storage, including encryption where appropriate. We keep your data only as long as necessary to provide our services and for legitimate business purposes.
            </p>

            <h2>Your data, your control</h2>
            <p>
                You can view and update your information through your account settings. If you'd like to delete your data or request a copy, just reach out to us at the address below.
            </p>

            <h2>Age</h2>
            <p>
                Stillwater is available only for those over the age of 4.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this policy from time to time. For any significant changes, we'll give you at least thirty days notice.
            </p>

            <h2>Questions?</h2>
            <p>
