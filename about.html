            <h1>About</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                Stillwater began at a riverbank, not a desk.
            </p>

            <p>
                There's a moment every angler knows. When the line hits the water, when the world goes quiet, when time stretches like the horizon. That moment is why we fish. Not for the catch. For the stillness.
            </p>

            <p>
                We built Stillwater because we couldn't find an app that understood this. Everything out there wanted to gamify the experience, turn fishing into a competition, flood us with notifications and social feeds. We didn't want followers. We wanted a field journal.
            </p>

            <h2>A Digital Field Journal</h2>

            <p>
                Stillwater is an offline-first fishing logbook for iOS. Take a photo of your catch, and our AI identifies the species. Your location is logged automatically. Over time, you build a personal record of every fish you've ever caught, organized by species, by water, by season.
            </p>

            <p>
                It works without cell service. Because the best fishing spots don't have WiFi.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Believe</h2>

            <p>
                We believe technology should serve the moment, not steal it. Stillwater is designed to get out of your way. Snap a photo, pocket your phone, get back to fishing. No feeds to scroll. No streaks to maintain. No pressure to share.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your catches are yours. Your waters are yours. Your peace is yours.
            </p>

            <h2>The Name</h2>

            <p>
                "Stillwater" refers to calm, non-flowing bodies of water: lakes, ponds, reservoirs. Places of reflection. But it's also a feeling. That rare, precious stillness we find when we step away from the noise.
            </p>

            <p>
                This app is our attempt to protect that feeling, not exploit it.
            </p>
